# Line_Follower_Bot
A line follower bot that is able to follow a white line on a black surface. The bot has the capabailty to handle various edge cases in the track that includes sharp right turn, shrap left turn, ignore small breaks in the track, etc 

Hardware Used : 
    
    1. Arduino Nano
    2. L298D Motor Driver
    3. N20 Geared Motors and wheels
    4. 8 channel IR sensor Array
    5. Li. ion battery
    6. BreadBoard, Jumper Wire, Verro Board, etc

Software Used :

    1. Arduino IDLE


The algorithm for the bot is based on the PID controller, the proportional, differential and Integral controller, with support for the edge cases.
